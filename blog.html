                <h5>Local storage</h5>
              <p class="card-text"></p>LocalStorage is similar to sessionStorage, except that while localStorage data has no expiration time, sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends — that is, when the page is closed.</p>

                <h5>Session storage</h5>
                <p class="card-text">The read-only sessionStorage property accesses a session Storage object for the current origin. sessionStorage is similar to localStorage; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends</p>

              <h5>global storage</h5>
              <p class="card-text">His is a deprecation error in Firefox 9.globalstorage was a way to store data in Firefox, but HTML5 introduced localstorage,which now uses localstorage.</p>
              <h5>Block storage</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Block storage is primarily used for: Database storage. Object storage provides consistent I/O performance, low latency, redundancy, and fault tolerance, making them ideal for resource intensive database applications. Storing data for applications that require service-side processing</p>

              <h5>Event loop</h5>
              <p class="card-text">JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java</p>

              <h3 class="card-title ">How JavaScript Event Loops Work ?</h3>
              <p class="card-text">The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
